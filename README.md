# DSND-Starbucks-Project
###  Libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- Scikitlearn
### Motivation
understand how customers respond to offers by building a model by 1st applying data analysis to understand the data and grasp the needed preparations to make the data ready for modeling, then prepare the data by data wrangling and preprocessing, analysing and visualizing important aspects of the data for insights and then apply several models to know what works well and what doesn't.
### RESULTS:
- There are more male customers than there are female customers
- Males are more likely to view and complete offers.
- The most common offer type among both genders is the BOGO offer then the discount offer ,and the least is the informational offer
- the year that added customers the most is the year 2017
- Customers with salaries more than 100k are mostly females
- average salaries for all age groups are 50k to 100k
- ML model to predict who will view and who will complete the offer
